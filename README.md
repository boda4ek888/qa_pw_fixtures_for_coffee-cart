# Fixtures for CoffeeCart Tests

## Preparation

1. Open the forked repo in VSCode.
2. Create a new branch by running `git checkout -b task_solution`.
3. Run the installation commands:

    - `npm ci`
    - `npx playwright install`

## Task

1. Create a `fixtures.ts` file in the `./tests/fixtures` folder.
2. Create the following fixtures for page classes initialization:

    - `menuPage`
    - `cartPage`   

3. Create a `constants.js` file in the `./src` folder. This file should export a constant object of coffee prices. For example: `{ espresso: 10, cappucino: 19}`.
4. Create the `getPriceForQuantity` helper method in the `src/common/helpers/getPriceForQuantity.ts` folder. This file should include the following three functions:

    - `unitPriceFormatStr` — gets `unitPrice` and `unitsNumber` as input and returns a formatted price, e.g.: `10.00 x 1`
    - `priceFormatStr` — gets `unitPrice` as input and returns a formatted price, e.g.: `$10.00`
    - `totalPriceFormatStr` — gets `totalPrice` as input and returns a formatted price, e.g.: `Total: $10.00`

5. Update all the tests to use corresponding fixtures for class initialization.
6. Update all the tests to use prices from constants and price formatting methods instead of hard-coded prices.
7. Re-run all your tests and make sure they pass after the updates.

## Task Reporting

1. Add and commit all your updates.
2. Push the code to the origin.
3. Create PR for your changes.
4. Fix all the suggestions from the code review until PR is approved.
